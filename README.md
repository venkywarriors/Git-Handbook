# Git-Handbook
Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git donâ€™t need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone
